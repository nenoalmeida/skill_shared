== skill shared

 This is a place where you go to get different skills, a place you can find friends to teach 
 you something and you can teach something to someone. This idea comes through the idea I had 
 about how hard is to learn something new completally alone. Nowadays we have a lot of tutorials 
 and many free books on the internet but they dont really leart you how to save time in your 
 learn process. And they dont teach you by mistakes. 
 o my mainly idea is to have a place you can do it with another person who's like you trying 
 to learn something too.

I hope you enjoy,
Neno
